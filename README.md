# CustomSeekBar
This is a fork of the repository: <https://github.com/karabaralex/android-comboseekbar>.

The goal of this project is to build an Android Widget that simulates a rectangular picker extending the Seekbar functionalities and using no XML file (all drawing is made by hand). It has an appearance similar to iOS Menu presented in Iphones.

## Features
 * Set the adapter and change the texts and values presented in the Seekbar. There is a Sample code to help you with it
 * Although the utilization of this widget is similar to a seekBar, it can be extended to be used as a Menu as well
 * The project still needs several modularization and lots of bug fixes. Feel free to propose changes and enhancements :) 

## Suggestions

I will appreciate any help to customize and enhance the library. Please, make any suggestion you find useful.
