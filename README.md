The goal of this project is to build an Android Widget that simulates a rectangular picker. It has an appearance similar to iOS Menu

## Features

 * This widget contains an X to cancel the value chosen, that can be suppressed
 * Although the utilization of this widget is similar to a seekBar, it will be extended, so users can use it as a Menu
 * The projects still needs modularization and some bug fixes 

## Suggestions

I will appreciate any help to customize and enhance the library. Please, make any suggestion you find useful.
