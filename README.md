This is a fork of the repository: <https://github.com/karabaralex/android-comboseekbar>.

The goal of this project is to build an Android Widget that simulates a rectangular picker. It has an appearance similar to iOS Menu

## Features

 * This widget contains an X to cancel the value chosen, it can be surpressed
 * Although the utilization of this widget is similar to a seekBar, it will be extended to be used as a Menu as well
 * The projects still needs several modularization and lots of bug fixes. Be patient meanwhile :) 

## Suggestions

I will appreciate any help to customize and enhance the library. Please, make any suggestion you find useful.
